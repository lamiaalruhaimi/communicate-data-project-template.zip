### Effects of Loan Characterics on Borrower's APR

##### By Lamia Alruhaimi

### Dataset

The data I'm working on contains 113,917 loans, including the annual interest rate for borrowing, status, amount borrowed, and debt, and I'll analyze the factors that affect the annual interest rate for borrowing and clean up the data by deleting unimportant columns and deleting missing values to provide more data. Reliability.

### Summary of results


I think the relationship is negative between BorrowerAPR and ProsperScore because the higher the annual percentage rate, the lower the Prosper score, and this is logical because the higher rated borrower tends to get a lower interest rate  (given from 0 to 11) 

Classification of borrowers is as follows: (HR) is the lowest rated borrowers with the highest APR.
(AA) with the highest rating and lowest APR. This visualization distinguishes groups of people in terms of annual percentage received.

### Key insights for your presentation

 A chart is created to visualize the allocation to the borrower in annual percentage points. After exploring all relevant borrower variables with the potential annual percentage rate. ProsperScore has the strongest relationship with the borrower's annual interest rate (correlated negatively). A scatter plot and heat map were also generated to see ProsperScore and BorrowerAPR both negatively correlated. The third plot created multiple scatter plots (BorrowerAPR versus ProsperScore) on different character classifications. The land plots showed that the lowest rating (HR) for borrowers had the highest APR, and the borrowers with the highest rating (AA) had the lowest APR.
