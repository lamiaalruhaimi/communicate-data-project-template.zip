Effects of Loan Characterics on Borrower's APR

Dataset

The dataset contains 113,917 loans, and each loan contains information about the annual percentage rate (APR) of each borrower, status, amount borrowed, debt, etc. Variables with many missing values have been dropped to make the dataset more accurate . Outliers have also been removed to provide more reliable data. This investigation will analyze the factors that can affect a borrower's annual interest rate and the loans obtained by any type of borrowers.


Summary of results

After analyzing all the variables. Borrowers' annual interest rate, borrowers score, rating, available bank card credit and credit score were found to be negatively correlated with the borrower's APR. In addition, the borrower's score (given from 0 to 11) gave the strongest negative relationship with the borrower's annual interest rate.


Borrowers with different letter ratings were also analyzed. It emerged that the borrowers with the lowest rating (HR) received a percentage higher than the annual interest rate, and the borrower with the highest rating (A) received a lower annual interest rate. This differentiates groups of people in terms of annual percentage received based on their rankings and scores.


Key insights for your presentation

 a chart is created to visualize the distribution on the annual percentage point borrower. After exploring all potential APR related borrower variables. ProsperScore has the strongest relationship with a borrower's annual interest rate (negatively correlated). The scatter plot and heat map were also created to see ProsperScore and BorrowerAPR are negatively related. The third plot created multiple scatter plots (BorrowerAPR versus ProsperScore) on different character classifications. The plots of land showed that the lowest rating (HR) of borrowers had the highest APR, and the borrowers with the highest rating (AA) had the lowest APR.
